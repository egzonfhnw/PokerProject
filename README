Do not gamble -- know your limit
Introduction

Our aim was to create a game for 4 players. If we start the game, the program is going to show 4 players. 
If there aren’t 4 players, the user should be able to define the amount of players with a button. 
As the GUI didn’t look good, we changed the background color and font style and size to make it look better. 
To make the GUI look better we changed the form of the buttons and added a hover method. 
Whenever you hover over a button you can see the orange hover effect. 
The button to change the player size can be pressed whenever you want and the program will not crash. 
After each dealing the program will evaluate the winner and loser hands and show it.
